anykeystore TODO
================

Nice-to-Have
------------

- Update the API to support locking.

- Provide a dogpile.cache adapter to allow anykeystore backends.

- Add a file backend. (shelve?)

- Fix testing API. Unit tests should always work via "setup.py test",
  whereas integration tests can only be run via nose with nose-testconfig.
